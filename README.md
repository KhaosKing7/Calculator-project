# Calculator-project
my first project thats all on my own
its a calculator (not a very good one) that asks you what operation you want to do and then takes 2 inputs and calculates that operation
it also stores the operation you just did and the answer in an arraylist and lets you print it when you are at the begining of the loop again

things i wanna add/wip stuff
- make it able calculate an equation head on, example i type in "1+(2*3) / 4" i would want it to evaluate the answer on its own without me having to do each operation one by one
- add a formulas section, where it lets you select a formula, say the formula for rectangular prism volume. then you would input your values for width length and height and volume.
then depending on which value is unkown it will print the answer and also save it into the memory.
